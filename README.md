A python voice assistant.

This project was initially a part of my startup idea, working on Augmented Reality glasses.

Iriis is a very basic voice assistant that can perform tasks such as:

- Tell you the time
- Tell you the weather
- Tell you a breif description of a person using Wikipedia

To use Iriis, all you need to do is clone this repo, open init_assistant.py in your choice IDE and run the python file.
